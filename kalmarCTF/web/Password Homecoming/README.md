# Password Homecoming [1000 pts]

**Category:** web
**Solves:** 0

## Description
>Yo, checkout this site I found.  I'm sure the admin is hiding a flag somewhere.  The site must be hackable (checkout the broken translations pages I've found [1] [2] [3]), but I can't hack it - can you help? Whenever I try to hack admin, he clicks *the abuse link* which bans my IP :'(

I already tried bruteforcing admins password, it can't be done.

(Challenge note: no bruteforce needed, handout added to show all endpoints - _which is also visible by just clicking the frontpage_)

* Rumor has it the admin has outsourced clicking to a soup of html5lib
