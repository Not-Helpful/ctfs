This chall is HARD (I think).
It requires intel vt-x sorry if you're on amd. We have special infra for this chall and we will do our best to assist you if shit breaks.
If everything fails contact zanderdk and we may be able to provide you with a private instance for a suitable region.
Timeout etc should not be a issue so contact if you have such problems.

Best of luck Zander
