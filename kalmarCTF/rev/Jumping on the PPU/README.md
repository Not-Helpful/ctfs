# Jumping on the PPU [1000 pts]

## Description
>I found an old blu-ray disc with a game on it so I decided to dump it, can you find anything interesting inside of it? (If you find a flag and it doesn't work, try the other challenge!)

Hint1:  It seems like you won't reach the flag through in normal gameplay. You may need to cheat a little

Hint2:  We have released an unstripped binary for these challenges. This required slight change to build script so we've also included a newly compiled stripped binary for completeness. (There should be no functional difference between the new and old stripped.)

#### Hint 

## Solution

## Flag
